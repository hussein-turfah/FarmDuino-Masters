# <div style="color:white;">FarmDuino</div>

> FarmDuino is a desktop application designed to revolutionize greenhouse farming by providing an intuitive and efficient solution for controlling the farming environment.

> Our goal is to empower greenhouse owners to easily manage and customize their greenhouse conditions, leading to improved crop yields and optimized farming processes.

> We designed FarmDuino using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

## <div style="color:white;">FarmDuino TechStack:</div>

- The project utilizes [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), a versatile microcontroller platform, to collect and analyze data from various farm sensors and control interconnected actuators.
- The project's backend utilizes the power of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a robust PHP framework renowned for its rapid and efficient web application development capabilities.
- The Web version is crafted with [React.js](https://react.dev/), a widely adopted JavaScript library specifically designed for creating dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
- We leverage [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) to build a versatile desktop application that seamlessly runs on multiple operating systems, providing users with a consistent experience across platforms.
- As for the Mobile application, our project seeks the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) programming language to further expand it's availability on almost all platforms, since flutter is known for it's cross-platform compatability.
